# CodeAlpha_Audio_Player
I have created an audio player using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It includes the following features:

1. Play and pause the track.
2. Navigate between tracks using the next and previous buttons.
3. Ability to enable auto replay mode to replay the track after the track ends.
4. Shuffle feature to mix up the playback order.
5. If the track ends the next track will start automatically.
6. Volume control range to adjust the volume.
7. Click on the volume icon to toggle between mute and unmute.
8. When you mute the volume and unmute it again it will return to the volume before mute.
9. When you move the volume range to zero it will mute automatically.
10. Audio time range control to choose a specific time.
11. If you are on pause mode and you move the time range it will not play. 
12. If you are in play mode and you move the time range, it will play automatically.
13. Browse the list of tracks by clicking the bar icon.
14. Loading animation appears while the audio is loading.
15. Display of a rotating CD while the audio is playing.
16. Display the track name, artist, and audio index.
17. Preferences are saved even after leaving the website or closing the browser.
18. On mobile phones the layout will be like a mobile application.
